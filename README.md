# Picture-picker
When pointed at a folder of pictures, the program selects some at random and cycles through them on a display. It then stop on a "winner"

When using the program, open it and resize the window to fit as desired. Do this before you start the slideshow to keep the size you want throughout.
The pictures must be in landscape as the program does not automatically flip any taken in portrait. 
As standard, the program picks a number between 6 and 11 and this is how many pictures are cycled to find the winner. When the radio buton "big boi" is selected, this increases the number it will cycle through by 10 i.e between 16-21.
The folder location is inputted in the expected text box at the top and remains after the program is closed. 
Once complete, a timer will start before a message box appears prompting you restart the program. This exists so you don't have to keep opening and closing the program.
The program supports both JPEG and PNG but not both at the same time. The radio buttons at the top are used as a filter for these two file types. 

The variables that have been mentioned in this readme are easy enough to customise to your own needs so have a play around if you need it to do different things to how I have set mine up.
